# simple-physics
An attempt at a simple rigid body physics engine in pure Python.

## Features:
* Rigid bodies with mass and restitution
* Convex polygon collision detection (with separating axis teorem)
* Impulse resolution
* Single contact point detection

## TODO:
* Friction / damping
* Gravity with turning effects
* Equilibrium / stability
* Optimization (currently it is very slow)

Requires `pygame==1.9.4` and Python 3.6 to run
